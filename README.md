# Django Encrypted Model Fields

## About

This is a fork of
<https://github.com/foundertherapy/django-cryptographic-fields>. It has
been renamed, and updated to properly support Python3 and latest
versions of Django.

`django-encrypted-model-fields` is set of fields that wrap standard
Django fields with encryption provided by the python cryptography
library. These fields are much more compatible with a 12-factor design
since they take their encryption key from the settings file instead of a
file on disk used by `keyczar`.

While keyczar is an excellent tool to use for encryption, it's not
compatible with Python 3, and it requires, for hosts like Heroku, that
you either check your key file into your git repository for deployment,
or implement manual post-deployment processing to write the key stored
in an environment variable into a file that keyczar can read.

## Generating an Encryption Key

There is a Django management command `generate_encryption_key` provided
with the `encrypted_model_fields` library. Use this command to generate
a new encryption key to set as `settings.FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:

    ./manage.py generate_encryption_key

Running this command will print an encryption key to the terminal, which
can be configured in your environment or settings file.

*NOTE: This command will ONLY work in a CLEAN, NEW django project that
does NOT import encrypted_model_fields in any of it's apps.* IF you are
already importing encrypted_model_fields, try running this in a python
shell instead:

    import os
    import base64

    new_key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(os.urandom(32))
    print(new_key)

## Getting Started

> $ pip install django-encrypted-model-fields

Add "encrypted_model_fields" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'encrypted_model_fields',
    )

`django-encrypted-model-fields` expects the encryption key to be
specified using `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your project's `settings.py`
file. For example, to load it from the local environment:

    import os

    FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY = os.environ.get('FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY', '')

To use an encrypted field in a Django model, use one of the fields from
the `encrypted_model_fields` module:

    from encrypted_model_fields.fields import EncryptedCharField

    class EncryptedFieldModel(models.Model):
        encrypted_char_field = EncryptedCharField(max_length=100)

For fields that require `max_length` to be specified, the `Encrypted`
variants of those fields will automatically increase the size of the
database field to hold the encrypted form of the content. For example, a
3 character CharField will automatically specify a database field size
of 100 characters when `EncryptedCharField(max_length=3)` is specified.

Due to the nature of the encrypted data, filtering by values contained
in encrypted fields won't work properly. Sorting is also not supported.

## Development Environment

Added Tox for testing with different versions of Django and Python. To get started:
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

using `pyenv` add the requisite python interpreters::
pyenv install 3.6.15

pyenv install 3.7.12

pyenv install 3.8.12

pyenv install 3.9.10

pyenv install 3.10.2

Add the requisite versions to the local version::
pyenv local 3.6.15 3.7.12 3.8.12 3.9.10 3.10.2

Run `tox`::
tox
